Instructions 

Before you begin: Read the "Trimester-Long Project - Overview and Specifications" page. This gives an overview and full specification for the project.

Overview

In Assignment 2, you will complete the client-side component of the trimester-long project. This should build upon the HTML / CSS prototype you developed for Assignment 1 Part (b). Now that you have your layout, it's time to add some client-side functionality!

Technical Specification

Please refer to the "assignment_project_specification.md" file in the git repo, or the "Trimester-Long Project Overview" assessment page on Moodle.

For this assignment, you are only required to develop and submit the client-side aspects of the requirements. In Assignment 3, you will deliver the entire app, with both client and server-side components.

React.js (v16.13.*).
Vue.js (v2.6.*).
You may choose 1 (and only 1) of the following CSS frameworks:

Bootstrap v4.5.*
Foundation v6.6.*
Pure CSS v2.0.*
If you have written your own custom styles, you should choose 1 (and only 1) of the following CSS preprocessor to overwrite your selected framework:

Sass (sass or scss)
Less CSS
Your own custom styles should be in less, sass or scss.
Note: you should already have a HTML / CSS prototype from Assignment 1 Part (b).
